        <li>Time begins when you hit the "Start" button for a New Game.
          <li>Feel free to skip the intro by loading from a save created immediately after in the Room of Awakening. Time begins from 6:40.867 as you gain control of Link. This is <span data-valid-at="2024-04-11">about 70 seconds slower than a top intro segment</span>, but means you can waste less of your life watching the cutscene while you learn the tough tricks in <a href="2_ascend.html">the next section.</a>
        <li>In either case, be sure to <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/totk?h=Any-v1-0-0&rules=game">read the rules</a> for setup details!

The fastest known movement through the intro was discovered by Timber and has a few main parts:
<ol>
    <li>"Intro Clip" which performs a climb jump clip near spawn, jumping out of bounds through the ceiling
    <li>Backwards long jump over the first cutscene trigger
    <li>Mozzdor jumps across the void to bypass the glowing MNF sword cutscene trigger
    <li>Climb jumps along the side of the long statue room to bypass the Zelda nerd cutscenes
    <li>Mozzdor jumps across the void to reach the exit trigger
    <li class="todo">(glossary links for mozzdors, blj)
</ol>

Different clip spots, setups, and other improvements have been found. However the general movement hasn't changed much over time, so comparing different approaches to see what works for you is a good idea.
